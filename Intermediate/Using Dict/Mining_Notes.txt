Points:

--these fields in tweets are itself dicts
    entities retweeted_status user extended_entities 
--Not all tweets have all of these fields

map(func_x,args) this takes args as input to func_x , operates and calculates result
If args is a list, it operates on every value
map(lambda x,y:x+y) : is the same operation without defining a func for it, x,y are arguments and x+y is operation
    -(or a temporary func as def lamba(args):
                                operation
so it is of the form map(lambda arg_list:operations)
