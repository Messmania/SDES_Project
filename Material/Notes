urllib.urlopen reads the website and returns a json object.
json.load converts it into a python object (one of the python types)

Installed tweepy library of python by first installin python-pip and then using pip to install tweepy
sudo pip install tweepy

OAuth in tweepy pkg is used to create authorization details.
and set_acces_token is used to set access token? (not very clear)

StreamListener is a class which has skeleton of methods in it. So we define a new class StdoutListener which
ineherits from this and overrides those methods.
See streaming.py for more info //this is a python library code, copied here for ease of use. it is located in /usr/lib/python2.7/tweepy/

Json.load and json.loads:
The functions with an s take string parameters. The others take file streams. 
foo = '{"age": 38}' 
my_json = json.loads(foo)
check test_json.py

Steps:
1. Streaming --DONE
    -Deleted tweets to be considered or not? Should be.
2. Preparing a dict with scores
3. Calculate score of every tweet
    -Check each word of the tweet's text in the dict and add the score.
4. Make a new list which has dict members, which maps each tweet(from tweet_list) to its score
    -newList=[{tweet_list[0]:score},{tweet_list[1]:score}..so on]
5. Get the total score when tweets are clubbed country wise, state wise etc
6. Make a graph with Total score->country, positive-Happy, 0-neutral, negative-Sad or angry
7. Get a GLOBAL map with color codes for display--CHALLENGE

Problems:
How to read multiple json objects in a file??--DONE convert it to a list
Either call processing method each time the tweet is obtained i.e in method STDOutListener, so that it is single json object. But this is not a good way.
First we must dump the whole data in a file and then process it. So a code file Mining.py reads that file and processes it.

--How to get all tweets without any filter
    --right now stream.sample() is returning deleted tweets too along with created ones, so may be ignore those deleted tweets(they have word delete) and process the rest--works

Mining ideas:
>Sentiment analysis:
state wise, and then displaying as pie chart and graphs
happier during which month? time of the day? Employed or student

>finding out who are the influential users who start a topic/trend? Also, one can see how long a trend has lived, making it interesting to note how popular some hashtag is/has been.

>Something you can look into is using your collection of Twitter data (i.e. tweets) to try and determine relationships between the users.
 In other words, if you had 6 months worth of tweets from an active Twitter user, could you build out his social network and determine who his "close" friends are?
This kind of research is pretty useful now a days in the area of social recommendations (think Twitter and Facebook).
>Searching for links on a particular topic(research or any topics) which have lots of likes/votes, and then downloading those pages as pdfs with name saved as "Votes-count"


Mining:
each tweet is of type dict
